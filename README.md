Repo contents
1. README.md (this document)
2. Codebook.md
3. run_analysis.R
4. A tidy dataset ("tidy.txt")

This is the final project of Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course.

As described in the project instructions, its purpose is to demonstrate "ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set". 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

In this repo you will find a codebook (Codebook.md) that describes the variables, the data, and work performed to clean up the data.

The data for this exercise is taken from data collected from accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones for a study involving 30 participant (subjects).

The data was obtained from the following site:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

It was downloaded from this address:

The repo also contains an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following, as per the instructions.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. A second independent tidy data ("tidy.txt") set has been created containing the averaged of each variable for each activity and each subject.
